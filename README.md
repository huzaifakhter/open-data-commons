# Open Data Commons

Open Data Commons is a centralized repository dedicated to providing **FREE, OPEN, and DOMAIN-AGNOSTIC** datasets for researchers, developers, and data scientists worldwide.

## Mission

Our mission is to lower the barrier to data access by curating high-quality datasets across various domains and releasing them entirely into the public domain. Whether you are training machine learning models, performing statistical analysis, or building data-driven applications, these datasets are yours to use without restrictions.

## License

All data hosted in this repository is released under the **Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)**. 

By using this data, you acknowledge that it is provided "as-is" without any warranties. You are free to copy, modify, distribute, and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

## Repository Structure

The data is organized by domain in the `datasets/` directory:

- `datasets/`: Root directory for all data collections.
  - `[domain]/`: Category-specific folder (e.g., `vehicles`, `weather`, `finance`).
    - `README.md`: Specific documentation for the dataset.
    - `data.csv`: The primary data file (preferred format is CSV).

## How to Use

Simply navigate to the `datasets/` folder, find the data you need, and download the CSV files.
